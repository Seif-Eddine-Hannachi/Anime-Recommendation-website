# Anime-Recommendation-Website

Welcome to the Anime-Recommendation-Website repository!
This Porject is made to create a machine learning recommendation model for animes using a database downloaded from Kaggle. And to implement it in a website after creating it using react.

##Learning Objectives

-Understanding the theory and application of recommending models in Python.
-Learn to load, analyze and process data using different python libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sktlearn, TensorFlow etc.
-Develop a collaborative filtering model using TensorFlow.
-Evaluate the model's performance and recommendation. 

###Porject Requirements

###DataSet 

The datasets used in this Porject is from kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset). Combining all the dataset together helped create a more precise classification model based on multiple behaviours.

- **anime-dataset-2023.csv**: The dataset offers valuable information for analyzing and comprehending the characteristics, ratings, popularity, and viewership of various anime shows. By utilizing this dataset, one can conduct a wide range of analyses, including identifying the highest-rated anime, exploring the most popular genres, examining the distribution of ratings, and gaining insights into viewer preferences and trends. Additionally, the dataset facilitates the creation of recommendation systems, time series analysis, and clustering to delve deeper into anime trends and user behavior.

- **user-details-2023.csv**: The User Details Dataset provides valuable information for analyzing user behavior and preferences on the anime platform. By examining mean scores and anime genres, you can gain insights into user preferences. Users can be segmented into different groups based on their watching behavior, such as active users and casual viewers. Personalized recommendation systems can be built using users' completed and plan-to-watch lists. Location-based analysis reveals anime popularity and user engagement in various countries. Trends in watching behavior, user retention, and gender-based differences in anime preferences can be identified. Additionally, you can explore rewatching habits and perform time series analysis to understand user engagement patterns over time.

-**user-score-2023.csv**:The User Score Dataset enables various analyses and insights into user interactions with anime. By examining user ratings for different anime titles, you can identify highly-rated and popular anime among users. Additionally, you can explore user preferences and watch patterns for specific anime titles. This dataset also forms the foundation for building recommendation systems based on user ratings, helping to suggest anime that align with individual tastes. Furthermore, you can perform collaborative filtering and similarity analysis to discover patterns of similar user interests. Overall, this dataset offers valuable information for understanding user engagement and preferences on the anime platform.
